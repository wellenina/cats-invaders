# cats-invaders
This is a simple game I built to learn Lua and [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/).

It's a version of the classic 1978 arcade game **Space Invaders** (スペースインベーダー) where the invaders are CATS (scary, right?) that will shoot various stuff at the player's character, while the player can move horizontally and shoot daikons at them.<br>
Instead of a finite grid of invaders that have to be defeated in order for the next grid to appear, this version has an infinite scrolling army of cats (super scary). Their speed and frequency of shootings progressively increase as the game go on. The player can choose among different characters and weapons. High scores and preferences are saved in local storage. Multiple languages are supported (English and Italian at the moment).

## You can download the game for both macOS and Windows from Itch.io [here](https://giuliafanzaghi.itch.io/cats-invaders)!<br>For free!
