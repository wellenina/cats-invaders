# cats-invaders
This is a simple game I'm building to learn Lua and LÖVE.

It's a version of the classic 1978 arcade game Space Invaders (スペースインベーダー) where the invaders are CATS (scary, right?) that will shoot various stuff at the player's character, while the player can move horizontally and shoot daikons at them.
Instead of a finite grid of invaders that have to be defeated in order for the next grid to appear, this version has an infinite scrolling of cats (super scary).

The assets are temporary at the moment and are from [Dotown](https://dotown.maeda-design-room.net/)
